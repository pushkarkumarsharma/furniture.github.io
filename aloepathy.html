    <li>Allopathic medicine, or allopathy, is an archaic term used to define science-based, modern medicine. There are
        regional variations in usage of the term. In the United States, the term is used to contrast with osteopathic
        medicine, especially in the field of medical education. In India, the term is used to distinguish modern
        medicine from Ayurveda, Homeopathy and other similar alternative/traditional medicine, especially when comparing
        treatments and drugs.</li>

    <li> Homeopathy looks at the horrors of Allopathy, by Alexander Beideman (1857)
        The terms were coined in 1810 by the inventor of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann.[3] It was originally used by
        19th-century homeopaths as a derogatory term for heroic medicine, the traditional European medicine of the time
        and a precursor to modern medicine, that did not rely on evidence of effectiveness. Heroic medicine was based on
        the belief that disease is caused by imbalance among the four "humours" (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black
        bile) and sought to treat disease symptoms by correcting that imbalance, using "harsh and abusive" methods to
        induce symptoms seen as opposite to those of diseases [4] rather than treating their underlying causes: disease
        was caused by an excess of one humour and thus would be treated with its "opposite".</li>
    <br><br>
    <li> A study released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2001 defined "allopathic medicine" as "the broad
        category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, biomedicine, evidence-based medicine, or
        modern medicine."[6] The WHO used the term in a global study in order to differentiate Western medicine from
        traditional medicine, and from complementary/alternative medicine, noting that in certain areas of the world
        “the legal standing of practitioners is equivalent to that of allopathic medicine” where practitioners are
        certified in both complementary/alternative medicine and Western medicine.

        The term allopathy was also used to describe anything that was not homeopathy.[5] Kimball Atwood, an American
        medical researcher and alternative medicine critic, said the meaning implied by the label of allopathy has never
        been accepted by conventional medicine and is still considered pejorative by some.American health advocate and
        skeptic William T. Jarvis, stated that "although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an
        allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid
        allegiance to an allopathic principle" and that the label "allopath" was "considered highly derisive by regular
        medicine."[8] Most modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics, for
        example) do not fit Hahnemann's definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness, or alleviate an
        illness by eliminating its cause.

    Etymology
    The terms "allopathic medicine" and "allopathy" are drawn from the Greek prefix ἄλλος, állos, "other," "different" +
    the suffix πάθος, páthos, "suffering".[11]
    <br><br>
    History
    The practice of medicine in both Europe and North America during the early 19th century is sometimes referred to as
    heroic medicine because of the extreme measures (such as bloodletting) sometimes employed in an effort to treat
    diseases.[12] The term allopath was used by Hahnemann and other early homeopaths to highlight the difference they
    perceived between homeopathy and the "conventional" heroic medicine of their time. With the term allopathy (meaning
    "other than the disease"), Hahnemann intended to point out how physicians with conventional training employed
    therapeutic approaches that, in his view, merely treated symptoms and failed to address the disharmony produced by
    underlying disease.[clarification needed] Homeopaths saw such symptomatic treatments as "opposites treating
    opposites" and believed these methods were harmful to patients.
    <br>
    Practitioners of alternative medicine have used the term "allopathic medicine" to refer to the practice of
    conventional medicine in both Europe and the United States since the 19th century. In that century, the term
    allopath was used most often as a derogatory name for the practitioners of heroic medicine, a precursor to modern
    medicine that itself did not rely on evidence of effectiveness.
    <br>
    James Whorton discusses this historical pejorative usage:
    One form of verbal warfare used in retaliation by irregulars was the word "allopathy". ..."Allopathy" and
    "allopathic" were liberally employed as pejoratives by all irregular physicians of the nineteenth century, and the
    terms were considered highly offensive by those at whom they were directed. The generally uncomplaining acceptance
    of [the term] "allopathic medicine" by today's physicians is an indication of both a lack of awareness of the term's
    historical use and the recent thawing of relations between irregulars and allopaths.

        <br>Allopathic medicines or drugs are not categorically risk-free, despite undergoing rigorous clinical trials
        and approval processes.

        The FDATrusted Source only considers a medication safe when the benefits outweigh the risks. Consequently, some
        people may experience side effects after taking prescription medications. Sometimes these side effects are
        minor, but they can be serious on rare occasions.

        Medication use risks include:

        Harmful interactions: This could happen when medication reacts with food or supplements a person has consumed.
        Allergic reaction: A person may not know they have an allergy to a specific ingredient within the medication
        until they take it.
        Unexpected effect: The medication works differently from what the doctor expected.
        It is important to note that although prescription drugs carry some risk of side effects, these risks are mostly
        minor and are unlikely to occur in most people.

        Furthermore, complementary ‘natural’ supplements do not undergo the same amountTrusted Source of testing. It is
        important for people to be aware that when a manufacturer markets a product as natural, it does not mean it is
        safe, nor does it mean it is safer than prescribed medication.
