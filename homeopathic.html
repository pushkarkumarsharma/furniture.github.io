    </h1>

    <ul> Homeopathy is a medical system based on the belief that the body can cure itself. Those who practice it use
        tiny
        amounts of natural substances, like plants and minerals. They believe these stimulate the healing process.

        It was developed in the late 1700s in Germany. It's common in many European countries, but it’s not quite as
        popular
        in the United States.

        <br>
        How Does It Work?
        A basic belief behind homeopathy is “like cures like.” In other words, something that brings on symptoms in a
        healthy person can -- in a very small dose -- treat an illness with similar symptoms. This is meant to trigger
        the
        body’s natural defenses.

        For example, red onion makes your eyes water. That’s why it’s used in homeopathic remedies for allergies.
        Treatments
        for other ailments are made from poison ivy, white arsenic, crushed whole bees, and an herb called arnica.
        Homeopathic doctors (who also are called “homeopaths”) weaken these ingredients by
        adding water or alcohol. Then they shake the mixture as part of a process called “potentization.” They believe
        this
        step transfers the healing essence. Homeopaths also believe that the lower the dose, the more powerful the
        medicine.
        In fact, many of these remedies no longer contain any molecules of the original substance. They come in a
        variety of
        forms, like sugar pellets, liquid drops, creams, gels, and tablets.
        Homeopathy, also known as homeopathic medicine, is a medical system that was developed in Germany more than 200
        years ago. It’s based on two unconventional theories:
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        “Like cures like”—the notion that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in
        healthy
        people.
        “Law of minimum dose”—the notion that the lower the dose of the medication, the greater its effectiveness. Many
        homeopathic products are so diluted that no molecules of the original substance remain.
        Homeopathic products come from plants (such as red onion, arnica [mountain herb], poison ivy, belladonna [deadly
        nightshade], and stinging nettle), minerals (such as white arsenic), or animals (such as crushed whole bees).
        Homeopathic products are often made as sugar pellets to be placed under the tongue; they may also be in other
        forms,
        such as ointments, gels, drops, creams, and tablets. Treatments are “individualized” or tailored to each
        person—it’s
        common for different people with the same condition to receive different treatments. Homeopathy uses a different
        diagnostic system for assigning treatments to individuals and recognizes clinical patterns of signs and symptoms
        that are different from those of conventional medicine.

        According to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, which included a comprehensive survey on the use of
        complementary health approaches by Americans, an estimated 5 million adults and 1 million children used
        homeopathy
        in the previous year. The 2012 survey also reported that although about 1.8 percent of children used homeopathy,
        only 0.2 percent of children went to a homeopathic practitioner. A 2016 analysis of data from this survey
        suggests
        that most adults who use homeopathic products self-prescribe them for colds and musculoskeletal pain.

        In 2016, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced it will hold efficacy and safety claims for
        over-the-counter homeopathic drugs to the same standard as those for other products making similar claims. It
        further stated that companies must have the competent and reliable scientific evidence the FTC requires for
        health-related claims, including claims that a product can treat specific conditions.

        In December 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a new risk-based enforcement approach to
        homeopathic products. The proposed approach would call for more careful scrutiny of products with the greatest
        potential for risk, including:

        Homeopathy is a controversial topic. A number of the key concepts underlying the theory of homeopathy are not
        consistent with fundamental scientific concepts as we understand them. For example, homeopathic preparations can
        be
        so dilute that a substance considered to be the “active ingredient” becomes unmeasurable, which creates major
        challenges to the rigorous investigation of such products. However, recent research has begun to examine
        physical
        attributes of these preparations to determine if it will be possible to characterize them in the future.
