    Ayurveda and Your Life Energy
    Students of CAM therapy believe that everything in the universe – dead or alive – is connected. If your mind, body,
    and spirit are in harmony with the universe, you have good health. When something disrupts this balance, you get
    sick. Among the things that can upset this balance are genetic or birth defects, injuries, climate and seasonal
    change, age, and your emotions.
    <br>
    Those who practice Ayurveda believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe: space, air,
    fire, water, and earth.
    <br>

    These combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas. They control how your body
    works. They are Vata dosha (space and air); Pitta dosha (fire and water); and Kapha dosha (water and earth).
    <br>
    Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas. But one is usually stronger than the others. Each one controls a
    different body function. It’s believed that your chances of getting sick -- and the health issues you develop -- are
    linked to the balance of your doshas.
    <br>

    Vata Dosha
    Those who practice Ayurveda believe this is the most powerful of all three doshas. It controls very basic body
    functions, like how cells divide. It also controls your mind, breathing, blood flow, heart function, and ability to
    get rid of waste through your intestines. Things that can disrupt it include eating again too soon after a meal,
    fear, grief, and staying up too late.
    <br>
    If vata dosha is your main life force, you’re thought to be more likely to develop conditions like anxiety
    <h1 align="center">what is Ayurveda</h1>
    <li>
        Ayurveda, a natural system of medicine, originated in India more than 3,000 years ago. The term Ayurveda is
        derived from the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). Thus, Ayurveda translates to
        knowledge of life.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ayurveda is attributed to Dhanvantari, the physician to the gods in Hindu mythology, who received it from
        Brahma. Its earliest concepts were set out in the portion of the Vedas known as the Atharvaveda (c. 2nd
        millennium bce).
